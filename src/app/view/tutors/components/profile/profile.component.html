          As a Computer Science student at the University of Mansoura, I am deeply immersed in the intricacies
          of software development and system design. My academic pursuits are complemented by a passion for
          teaching, where I assist fellow students in understanding complex engineering concepts. With a strong
          grasp of programming, data structures, and digital systems, I provide peer-to-peer tutoring, making
          challenging subjects more accessible. My approach is patient and tailored, ensuring that each student
          grasps the fundamentals for practical application. Beyond academics, I engage in coding competitions
          and workshops, continually expanding my skills and fostering a collaborative learning environment.
